chromophobe
===========

this is an R package to assist in working with segmentation models, such as 
those produced by ChromHMM ( http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/ ). 


NEW NEWS!
=========

ChromHMM itself is now on GitHub at https://github.com/jernst98/ChromHMM/

You probably want to watch/star that repository too, if you're using this one.
